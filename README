An implementation of a log-structured filesystem into xv6.
Jon Morton, 2011.

current limitations:
        - only one inode per block. this greatly simplifies the imap.
        - the imap can only be one block long.
        - writing to inodes cannot extend into indirect levels.

implementation order, as time allows:
        [x] mkfs
        [x] read-only lfs
        [x] segment writing
        [ ] segment cleaning

(original xv6 readme is in README.xv6)
