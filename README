An implementation of a log-structured filesystem into xv6.
Jon Morton, 2011.

current limitations:
        - only one inode per block. this greatly simplifies the imap.
        - the imap can only be one block long (1024 inodes).
        - bmap only maps with INDIRECT_LEVELS == 2

implementation order, as time allows:
        [ ] mkfs
        [ ] read-only lfs
        [ ] segment writing
        [ ] segment cleaning

(original xv6 readme is in README.xv6)
